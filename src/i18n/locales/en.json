        "q": "What is a depreciated asset?",
        "a": "A depreciated asset is property (movable or immovable) whose value has significantly decreased, often in the context of liquidation, bankruptcy or restructuring.

      },
      "services3": {
        "q": "How does real estate intermediation work?",
        "a": "As an authorized intermediary, we facilitate real estate transactions by connecting buyers and sellers, negotiating sale conditions, managing legal documentation and ensuring follow-up until transaction completion. We work with residential, commercial and industrial properties in Geneva and Switzerland."
      },
      "services4": {
        "q": "Do you offer SME consulting services?",
        "a": "Yes, we offer strategic consulting services to small and medium-sized enterprises, particularly in restructuring, operational optimization, asset management and preparation for transfer.

        "q": "How does a first contact work?",
        "a": "You can contact us by phone (022 789 00 60), email (omar@deiri.ch) or via the contact form on our website. We guarantee a response within 24h. A first meeting (on-site or online) will allow us to understand your needs and propose an adapted solution. All exchanges are strictly confidential."
      },
      "process2": {
        "q": "What are your response times?",
        "a": "We commit to responding to all requests within 24 business hours. For depreciated assets requiring rapid action, we can intervene in even shorter timeframes. Reactivity is essential in our field of activity."
      },
      "process3": {
        "q": "What documents should I prepare for a transaction?",
        "a": "Required documents vary according to the type of transaction. For a real estate transaction: title deed, surface certificate, expert reports, charge status. For a business transfer: annual accounts, employment contracts, leases, authorizations. We will provide you with a detailed list adapted to your situation during the first meeting."
      },
      "legal1": {
        "q": "Are you authorized to practice in Switzerland?",
        "a": "Yes, OD - Omar Deiri is a business agency authorized by the Geneva State Council. We respect all Swiss regulations regarding real estate intermediation and business consulting. Our authorization guarantees our professionalism and legal compliance."
      },

      "legal3": {
        "q": "What are your fees?",
        "a": "Our fees vary according to the type of service and the complexity of the file. They are generally based on a percentage of the transaction or on a flat-rate basis, always agreed in advance and formalized in writing. We prioritize transparency and will provide you with a detailed quote without commitment after the first meeting."
      },
      "geographic1": {
        "q": "Do you only operate in Geneva?",
        "a": "Although our headquarters is in Geneva, we operate throughout French-speaking Switzerland and can handle files in other regions as needed. For depreciated assets and certain specific transactions, we can also operate internationally in collaboration with our partners."
      },
      "geographic2": {
        "q": "Can you organize online appointments?",

      },
      "urgency1": {
        "q": "Why is speed important for depreciated assets?",
        "a": "Depreciated assets often require rapid action because they are generally linked to liquidation or urgent restructuring situations.

        "q": "What is your experience?",
